                    <p><em>The Godfather</em> is the greatest italian mobster movie ever created.
                        I personally think it is one of the greatest films of all time.
                        I could watch this movie 100 times and still not get tired of it.

                        Marlon Brando and Al Pacino gave an amazing performance in this film.
                        This film has some of the most iconic lines ever in film making including
                        when Marlon Brando said "I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse".
                        This film is an absolute masterpiece and is a must watch for everyone.

                        <h3>Trivia</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Former pro wrestler Lenny Montana, who played Luca Brasi, was so nervous to act with Marlon Brando that he couldnt muster a good take of the scene in the Godfathers study on the day of his daughters wedding, despite a full day of shooting. Coppola didnt have time to reshoot the scene, so he incorporated Montanas best attempt in the movie. The result is a revealing look at the softer side of a merciless killer.</li>
                            <li>In the films opening scene, Vito is famously seen holding a cat. Amazingly this was a stray - there was no cat in the original script. Francis Ford Coppola found it while walking through the lot at Paramount Studios and wrote it into the movie. Its ludicrously loud purring muffled some of Brandos lines, which meant they had to be looped over.</li>
                            <li>Spare a thought for actor John Marley who, during rehearsals, would "wake up" to find a fake horses head in bed with him. When the cameras rolled, without him knowing, a real horses head from a dog-food factory was used. His screams were real. Animal rights groups unsuccessfully protested the inclusion of the scene.</li>
